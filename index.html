        <div class="client-box">
            <h3>Savy Morgen</h3>
            <p>Food is incredibly delicious. The price, portion & quality, no complaints, just perfect. Staffs really sweet & attentive to each and everyone, really kind & positive atmosphere. Coming back again & again in groups.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="client-box">
            <h3>Marie Robert</h3>
            <p>The chicken burgers are the best on the island no doubt. Very juicy and tender. I like the Buffalo one since I can't imagine eating without sauce and i don't like spice too much. The aesthetics of the food matches the menu pictures. I like how the quality has stayed the same from their previous location. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="client-box">
            <h3>Jean Claude</h3>
            <p>The staff are very welcoming and attentive to your every need. We waited no more than 10 minutes before we had received our full order. The food was delicious and the atmosphere calm. Will definitely returns!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="client-box">
            <h3>Gav Curpen</h3>
            <p>If you like burgers you would like to at least give it a try. The burgers are juicy and tasty and full of flavours. They use actual chicken and beef instead of precooked patties. On the down side, it took us at least half an hour to get our order even though the place was not crowded when we went.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="client-box">
            <h3>Sebastian Alexa</h3>
            <p>It was my first visit and got to say the welcome was amazing. Great atmosphere and the chicken burger were out of this world. Definitely recommend & burgers to all the food lovers out there!</p>
